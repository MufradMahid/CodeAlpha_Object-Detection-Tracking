# CodeAlpha_Object-Detection-Tracking
This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and Deep SORT. Objects are detected from a video file, assigned unique IDs and tracked across frames. Built with Python and OpenCV to demonstrate practical computer vision and deep learning skills.


🚀 Task 4: Object Detection and Tracking

“In this demo, I am using a video file as input instead of a live webcam.”
